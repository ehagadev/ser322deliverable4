# SER 322 Deliverable 4

This is a simple Spring Boot application developed for the SER 322 course deliverable 4.

## Overview

The project is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates the integration of Thymeleaf for UI rendering, H2 (an SQL db) database for data storage, and basic controller endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or later)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

### Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf
- H2 Database

## System Architecture
- (UI/View) Forms in the front to accept query parameters, upon submission we hit an endpoint in a controller method where those input parameters are passed
- (UI/View) Controller consumes input parameters (either an object or primitive data types) and calls a service method based on that specific query and passed in parameters
- Service Method handles business logic, i.e.,  calls repo layer where actual query is defined with the proper SQL statement and annotated to a java method (see user repo for example). Service method passes response from the repo layer back up to the controller
- Define actual query statement on a java method (done in the repository interface)
- (UI/View) Controller takes service layer response and displays/renders template for user
